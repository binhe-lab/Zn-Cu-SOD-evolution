# Zn-Cu-SOD-evolution
Evolution of the Zn/Cu gene family in yeasts. This project was initiated in 2020 by Amanda Caraballo, and was taken over by our high school intern Ananya Albrecht-Buehler. It was motivated by the fact that _C. albicans_ have 6 SOD genes, four of which belong to the Zn/Cu SOD family. Most other yeast species have just 1 or 2 in that family. We therefore would like to identify the origin of the extra copies and how they have evolved in sequence and in function.
